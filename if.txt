If you are an undergraduate student who wants to get involved in this teacher's research activities. 
That's no problem, because the students in this lab will plan carefully for you (under the teacher's arrangement).

But for graduate and PhD students, this teacher can only give you a certain amount of project experience, but may not be able to satisfy your academic pursuits. I hope you will consider it carefully.
